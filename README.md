# Flycatcher-Project-M2-
Master M2: Investigation of the role of splicing variants in the context of speciation

##The project focus on the characterization of splicing variants in two closely related ficedula flycatchers.

##Differential Splicing Analysis (DSA): Comparing alternative splicing events between Pied and Collared flycatchers, as well as between their respective F1 hybrids, across five distinct tissues .. 

##Each tissue will be analyzed individually to identify differential splicing events using two specialized tools, LeafCutter and DEXSeq.
